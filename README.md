# Team Performance Analysis: MLS Home-Field Advantage

This project explores **home-field advantage in Major League Soccer (MLS)** from 2015–2019. Using match data, we investigate how playing at home affects points earned, both across seasons and at the team level.

## Contents
* `data/raw/` - Original CSVs from Kaggle
* `data/processed/` - Filtered and cleaned datasets
* `notebooks/` - Colab Notebook and R file
* `figures/` - Plots and visualizations

## Objective
* Understand the impact of home games on team performance
* Quantify home-field advantage in terms of points earned
* Visualize trends across teams and seasons

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels)
* Regression analysis (OLS)
* Data cleaning and processing
* Data visualization and storytelling
* **R replication**: The analysis was also reproduced in R to showcase proficiency in multiple tools

## Insights
* Teams consistently earn more points at home — confirming a home-field advantage.
* Year- and team-level effects give hints of trends, even when estimates are noisy.
* Visualizations highlight the relative strength of home advantage for each team.

## Next Steps
* Incorporate more detailed match-level statistics (shots, possession, player metrics)
* Explore player-level performance and team strategies
* Extend analysis to NWSL for comparison with MLS
* Use insights from both Python and R versions to cross-validate results
