# Team Performance Analysis: MLS Home-Field Advantage (2015–2019)

This project investigates **home-field advantage in Major League Soccer (MLS)** using match data from 2015–2019. The analysis explores how playing at home impacts points earned, both across seasons and at the team level.

## Contents
* `data/raw/` – Original CSV files from Kaggle
* `data/processed/` – Filtered and cleaned datasets used for analysis
* `notebooks/` – Python (Colab) notebook and R Markdown notebook
* `visuals/` – Visualizations generated during the analysis

## Objective
* Quantify the effect of home games on team performance (points earned)
* Examine trends over multiple seasons
* Compare team-level differences in home-field advantage
* Showcase reproducibility across Python and R

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* **Python:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels  
* **R:** tidyverse, ggplot2, R Markdown for replication  
* Regression analysis (OLS) with team- and season-level effects  
* Data cleaning and preprocessing  
* Data visualization and storytelling  
* Reproducibility: full analysis performed in both Python and R  

## Key Findings
* Teams earn more points at home, confirming a measurable home-field advantage  
* Home advantage is relatively consistent across seasons  
* Team-level estimates highlight the strongest and weakest home-field performers  
* Visualizations make trends and relative advantages easy to compare

## Next Steps
* Incorporate additional match-level statistics (shots, possession, fouls, cards)  
* Explore player-level performance and team strategies  
* Compare MLS with NWSL home-field trends  
* Use insights from both Python and R analyses to cross-validate results  

## Notes
* The R Markdown notebook produces a fully reproducible analysis, including visualizations and tables  
* The project can serve as a baseline for more advanced statistical modeling of soccer performance
